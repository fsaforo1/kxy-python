Higher ROI Machine Learning Projects
====================================
The :code:`kxy` package utilizes information theory to takes *trial and error* out of machine learning projects. 

From the get-go, the **achievable performance analysis** of the :code:`kxy` package tells data scientists whether their datasets are sufficiently informative to achieve a performance (e.g. :math:`R^2`, maximum log-likelihood, and classification error) to their liking in a classification or regression problem, and if so what is the best performance that can be achieved using said datasets. *No need to train tens of models to know what performance can be achieved*.

The **model-free variable selection analysis** provided by the :code:`kxy` package allows data scientists to train smaller models, faster, cheaper, and to achieve a higher performance than throwing all inputs in a big model or proceeding by trial-and-error.

Once a model has been trained, the :code:`kxy` **improvability analysis** quantifies the extent to which the trained model can be improved without resorting to additional features. This allows data scientists to focus their modeling efforts on high ROI initiatives. *No need to implement tens of fancy models on specialized hardware to see whether a trained model can be improved*.

When a classification or regression model has successfully extracted all the value in using the features to predict the label, the :code:`kxy` **dataset valuation analysis** allows data scientists to quickly quantify the performance increase (e.g. :math:`R^2`, maximum log-likelihood, and classification error) that a new dataset may bring about. *No need to train or retrain tens of models with the new datasets to see whether the production model can be improved*.



===========
Model Audit
===========
From **understanding** the marginal contribution of each variable towards the decision made by **a black-box regression or classification model**, to **detecting bias** in your trained classification and regression model, the :code:`kxy` toolkit allows data scientists and decision markers to fully **audit complex machine learning models**.

=================================
Modern Financial Machine Learning
=================================
From **non-Gaussian** and **memory-robust** risk analysis, to **alternative datasets valuation** the :code:`kxy` toolkit propels quants from the age of Gaussian distributions/linear regression/LASSO/Ridge/Random Forest into the age of modern machine learning, rigorously and cost-effectively.
